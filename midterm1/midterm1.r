# Please load in the dataset included in the midterm1 directory. It will be

# variables <mean.bsqft> and <med.bsqft> respectively.

# For each house in the dataset, calculate the squared difference between its
# bsqft and the median bsqft of houses in Berkeley. Store this as the variable
# <bsqft.diffs>. Note that this should be a numeric vector with length equal to
# the number of observations in the dataset

bsqft.diffs <- sapply(housing$bsqft, function(p) (p - med.bsqft))



# Please create two new data frames with the following two subsets
# and store them with the indicated names:
# 1) houses whose bsqft is strictly greater than <mean.bsqft>:  <bsft.greater>
# 2) houses whose bsqft is less than or equal to  <mean.bsqft>: <bsqft.less>

# these variables <rooms.greater.price> and <rooms.less.price>.

rooms.greater.price <- bsqft.greater$price

# Please implement the function priceByRooms. Your function should take the
# following arguments:
#
# <room.range>: a numeric vector of length 2 whose first and second observations
#   give the minimum and maximum number of rooms to consider
# <br>: a numeric vector giving the number of bedrooms for each observation
# <prices>: a numeric vector giving the price of each observation associated
#   with <br>
#
# Your function should return the average of <prices> for all observations with
# <br> in the range (inclusive) specified by <room.range>

  return(mean(prices[room.range[1]<= br & room.range[2]>=br]))

# Please create a plot of house price (y-axis) against br (x-axis). Your plot
# should include the following features:
# 1) a title "Housing price vs Number of Rooms"
# 2) axis labels: "price" and "number of rooms"
# 3) plotting character set to 20
